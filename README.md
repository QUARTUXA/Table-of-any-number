# Table-of-any-number
# Multiplication Table Generator

This C++ program generates a multiplication table for a given number. Let's break down the code step by step.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

These lines include the necessary header files for input and output operations in C++ and specify that you will be using the std namespace, which is a common practice in C++ programming.

int main() {
  int a;
  int i = 0;
  int d  = 0;
This is the main function, which is the entry point of your program. Inside the main function, you declare three integer variables: a, i, and d.

a will store the number for which you want to generate the multiplication table.
i is an index that keeps track of the current iteration.
d is another index that keeps track of the current iteration for the table row.
  cout << "This Program Show You Table Of Any Number";
  cout << "\nEnter Your Number: ";
  cin >> a;
These lines are used to display a message to the user, asking them to enter a number for which they want to generate a multiplication table. The user's input is stored in the variable a using cin.

  do {
    cout << a << " x " << d << " = " << a * i << endl;
    i++;
    d++;
  } while (i <= 10 && d <= 10);
This is the core logic of your program. It uses a do-while loop to generate the multiplication table. Here's how it works:

The loop will execute at least once because it's a do-while loop.
Inside the loop, it calculates and prints the multiplication of a and i along with the current values of a and d.
It then increments both i and d by 1.
The loop continues as long as both i and d are less than or equal to 10.
  return 0;
}
Finally, your program returns 0 to indicate successful execution to the operating system.
